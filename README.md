# Airports _USA
In this project, I explore the characteristics and causes of commercial airplane flight delays in the United States. I want to investigate what months delays are most likely to occur and which airline carriers and airports have the best and worst track records for delays.

The dataset corresponds to airline flight statistics and delay causes for airports in the United States. The observations are reported by month, year, airline and airport for the period between January 2011 and December 2020. The data was downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp. The total number of observations for the clean dataset is 157,906.
